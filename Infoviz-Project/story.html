			<p align="justify">On December 17th, 2010, Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire to protest repeated mistreatment by the police. Protests over the Tunisian regime began almost instantly, and spread throughout the country. During early 2011, the Arab Spring protests spread across numerous countries in North Africa and the Middle East. In Tunesia, 23-year president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country on January 14th. Protests also forced Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to resign on February 11th. Libya also experienced a regime change after a civil war resulting in the death of president Muammar Gaddafi.</p>

			<p align="justify">Protests also began in Syria in April and May of 2011, and quickly spread throughout the country. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad originally promised some reforms of his authoritrian government, but as it became clear that the protesters would accept nothing less than him stepping down, the protesters and the regime used escalating violence.</p>

			<p align="justify">The Free Syrian Army was formed on July 29th 2011 by former Syrian Army generals. The conflict continued to escalate after numerous failed cease fires, and the conflict was worsened by the creation of the Islamic State. After multiple years of conflict, the situation in Syria as well as in neighboring Iraq has developed into a significant humanitarian crisis, which has resulted in millions of Syrians fleeing their country for safety.</p>

			<p align="justify">Two visualizations have been developed to explore this crisis. The timeline view shows the flow of refugees into surrounding countries as the conflict worsened, connected with key events. The map view shows aslyum applications in each EU country, which can be compared with economic data.</p>
